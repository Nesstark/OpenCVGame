**Rocket Launcher Game**  

As part of my *Image Processing* course, I created this small Python game using OpenCV and MediaPipe. 
Your face controls a rocket as it ascends through Earth's atmosphere, dodging obstacles and aiming for the exosphere. 
So strap in for a long ride! ðŸš€

------------
**Gameplay Objective**:
Guide your rocket to achieve orbital altitude (10.000 km) while avoiding obstacles. The further you go, the higher your score and the closer you are to the exosphere.

Controls:
- Use your face to guide the rocket left or right.
- Press Q anytime to quit the game.
